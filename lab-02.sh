echo "There are many techniques of algorithms such as
- Brute force
- Divide-and-Conquer
- Decrease-and-Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Transform and conquer

- One level grade of algorithm class will be deduct from Mr. Rama II and Boy

To measure algorithm efficiency, we use Big-O, Big-Omega and Big-Theta

Classic problems in algorithm learnging are GCD, Bumber Multiplication, Travelling Saleman, Knapsack, Matrix multiplication and Sorting

Famous people of algorithms are Euclid, Djikstra, Floyd, Warshall, Earth (one day about thousand year from now)" > algorithms2
